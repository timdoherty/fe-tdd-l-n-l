# FETDD ToDo App

This repo walks through building a bare-bones ToDo app using TDD

## Step 0

Step 0 has an empty Create React App project, with added dependencies and configuration for React component testing with Enzyme.
In this step we'll walk through the basic plubming of a vanilla JS unit test.

## Step 1
Step 1 starts with BDD style assertions that might fit the basic requirements for a "todos" module. From here we'll try to make some of these tests pass, then refactor the passing code.

## Step 2
Step 2 starts with passing specs and refactored code for our vanilla JS "todos" module, along with BDD style assertions that might fit the basic requirements for a "todo item" React component.
From here we'll try to make some of these tests pass, then refactor the passing code.

## Step 3
Step 3 starts with passing specs and refactored code for our "todo item" React component, along with BDD style assertions that might fit the basic requirements for a "todo list" React component.
